## Reflection Document

### HTML

This practice section helped me learned about the HTML how to upload a photo and how to make the form with html, and I felt the most important part is we get the chance to understand the html element, and it can get us a good practice on get the semantics correctness especially its important to get wave passed. I used the video to help me get the form part correctly.

### a11y

This one is the same idea with the html section practice. But it is good to do an extra practice and review how the button, submit/reset works, and we reviewed the important of getting the fieldset and legend settled correctly. I could mostly get it done by myself.

### flexbox

For the flex box section, there is only one practice but this one would alow me to have the chance to understand the basic concept of how to build box into different positions, with multiple boxes in one container or multiple containers. I used the video a lot for this practice but this practice, however this practice have the chance to helped me to explore very kinds of different layout and format for using flexbox. I could also use the skills I learned to scratch for my little projects.

### css-grid

The css grid section lab notes is really helpful for me to understand how to adjust the formatting for the grid by using the css. I do appreciated we have the chance to 'living coding' with Caterina while watching the video, and think about it and then work on that and try it to see if I could got my expected result. This pare is awesome I liked it a lot. The other part I like is the design for the practice/notebook it self, it covered some really comment 'questions' area at lease its the one I want to know more. I like this practice very much.

### bootstrap

I felt this one is one of the most interested one for me and I like this a lot. I have the chance to practiced on cards and gris style but this time is using bootstrap,its feels more convenient than we build from the scratch from last practice section. The more importance part of the video I liked a lot is how Caterina walked us how to referring the document for find the relative information that really helped.

### javascript

This one is one of my favorite practice beside the css-grid and html. I found the video has been helped a lot for me in both understanding and get practice it for implementing some JS code/practices. For this section I used the video a lot both as the solution and as the learning materials. I like the idea we get practiced in different aspect in .JS to do different job like DOM practice, I like the idea we also get chance to practice DOM with fetch section, it is also very helpful for the homework assignment3.

### jquery

For the first section I was not relay on video a lot, but for the second practice I need to relay on the video. This section is not as heavy as the css/js sections, but it do offers me a chance to practice on the jquery, I found the video has explained those concept very clean. I like the practice regardless it is not that syntax heavy. I hope in the future course like in front-end web development class that we can cover this topic more.
